        <h3>Stephen King's best adapted movie</h3>
            <p>I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The <strong>Shawshank Redemption</strong>. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, <br> 
            and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the <br> 
            characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through. <br><br>
            
            King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. <br> 
            But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the <br> 
            aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King <br> 
            film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. <br>
            
            What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, <br> 
            has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. <br> 
            His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different <br> 
            feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again. <br>
